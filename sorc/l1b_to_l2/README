ssmis_tol2:
   read in L1b BUFR data from NCEP data tanks, computes some filters, computes sea ice concentration using the NASA Team algorithm, and write out the Tb, flags, lat, lon, observed time*, and concentration. 

bayes: 
   do some bayesian filter construction/testing

demo:
    output and demostration diagnostics of filters


ssmis_tol2:
  algorithm.c     -- apply Team weather filter and compute ice concentration 
  filter.c        -- locally-developed land/water/mixed filters
  skel.c          -- netcdf segment, call filters and algorithm
  bufr.c          -- initial check on values from BUFR decode
  ssmisu_decode.f -- do the BUFR reading from the tank
