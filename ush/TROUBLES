Information about problems is in the individual scripts.

The main issue is in the imsice*.sh scripts, where they want an IMS ice 
analysis.  In operations, the analysis is in /dcom  The main failure mode 
is probably to not have an updated analysis to work with.  Script should 
proceed gracefully even without a new analysis.

Gracefully still means that it won't complete everything it would if the 
analysis were present.  But the downstream usages do not require that.  
The script exits in a state that the downstream may proceed normally.
