--------   Version 4.0.0 Implementation 2012 -------------------------------------

In brief:
I'm now running in user parallel the new sea ice concentration system.  
It includes the new vertical structure, grib2 output, newer polar 
stereographic land masks, F17 sea ice concentration, improved weather 
filter for F15 sea ice concentration, updated AMSR ice algorithm, and 
improved management of AMSR data input.  Output is on cirrus in 
/marine/noscrub/wx21rg/com/developer/sice.YYYYMMDD  As expected, while 
we still have the old satellite, adding the newer one makes little change 
to the products.  But it is still worth testing it in your own systems 
to ensure that none of these things which look minor to me are major to 
you.  20120403 is the first day with the new system's output.  I will 
start running this from cron on cirrus.


At Length:

Downstream users note and question thereto:
There are some changes to the polar stereographic land masks, the half 
degree lat-long land mask, and deletions of files that, as best I can 
see, nobody is using.  Particular groups to look for effects on their 
operations are the SST analysis folks, and the GFS (the latter might be 
making use of these legacy to-be-deleted files, but probably aren't).  
Please verify that your jobs are not adversely affected by the new 
version sea ice. 

Directories which exist, but are empty, in my mapping of the vertical structure on emcsvn:

    dictionaries, exec, gempak, lib, ush, util -- no expectation of 
needing these; they are place holders for the future.

Directories with new or changed content:

    jobs -- renaming the job from JMRF_ICEDRFT2 to JSEAICE_CONCENTRATION_ANALYSIS
    scripts -- renamed likewise
    parm -- new directory, contains parameters for the generation of GRIB2 sea ice output files
    sorc -- see below
    fix -- see below


External libraries used:

    mmablib (separate RFC coming)
    bacio (will use current /nwprod/lib version)
    bufrlib ("")
    w3lib ("")


External utilities used:
dumpjb


In the future:

    It will be good to remove the MRF network from this job and replace 
with an MMAB network.
    For now, GRIB1 programs are still running in the job.  These also 
generate the WMO files and I don't know where WMO stands on our 
unilaterally changing to GRIB2, nor am I confident about how to make that change.
    There is currently no AMSR data coming.  Nonetheless, the old instrument 
has not been declared dead, so such data could come in the future.  And 
May 18th 2012 expects the launch of a new AMSR instrument (AMSR2 on GCOM-W).  
Therefore, the upgrades which were abandoned last fall with the loss of 
AMSRE data are implemented here in the source.
    In similar vein, the weather filter improvements for SSMI on F-15 
which were not implemented last fall as they did not make marked difference, 
are implemented here.

Source Future:

It would be nice to completely separate the preliminary analysis programs 
(listed under SSMI, AMSR, SSMI-S in sorc) to jobs separate from the 
general assembly of ice concentration fields in to a coherent analysis 
(listed under general).  The satellite analyses may then run independently 
of the assembly, in parallel.  And adding or deleting satellite would 
become a more straightforward process.


Remove directory nasateam2.algorithm, ssmis/reference 
  -- developer oops left it in the implementation tree.  
     These is developer reference only.

delete empty directory ush
delete top level 'makeall.sh', this need only begin in sorc directory

Change makefiles to point to gfortran, g++, gcc on wcoss system, vs AIX ncepxlF, etc.
give type conversion to 'sizeof' -related prints.

--------   End Version 4.0.0 Implementation 2012 -------------------------------------

----------------        Changes 2004 to 2012     ---------------------------------

ssmimain.c
  an extracted main program for ssmi data processing.  Later morphs to ssmi.main.c, and
then ssmi.main.C

  originally read sdr format, and did its own date management.

  For operational implementation, moved to bufr format.

  later, changed to expect data files to be pre-selected to be appropriate
and stopped date management.  This is why jday is now unused argument.


  added hires approach to ssmi.main.c -- regression of sqrt(v^2 - h^2) on
team1 over clear points.  16 mar 2004 in my version.  added counts for
which errors are flagged in qc.  Also start using all ssmi rather than only
F-13.

  team2 added to ssmi.main.C

  Feb 2009: added satno as an argument.  Prompted by loss of F-14 and
bad data from F-15.

  10/31/2011 (mine) new weather filtering approach for F-15, last of the SSMI
and corrupted in 22 GHz.

Fixed fields:

New seaice fixed files -------------------------------------
seaice_nland127.map :
  byte array of land mask flags
  derived from GMT land and water mapping
  points that were 'ice' covered in summer masked out to coast.

seaice_sland127.map :
  byte array of land mask flags
  derived from GMT land and water mapping
  points that were 'ice' covered in summer masked out to coast.

seaice_gland5min    :
  byte array of land mask flags
  derived from GMT land and water mapping
  points that can not be filled from an ocean point on the 12.7 km grids
    masked out as 151 (unfillable ocean) -- these may be fillable in the
    future as higher resolution and better algorithms become available.
    50907 such points.
  'land' points that can be filled from an ocean point of the 12.7 km grid
    masked as 150 (fillable land).  These exist because of differences in
    locating bounding points of polygon segments from GMT.
    9611 such points

seaice_newland.pct :
  floating point array of fraction of 30 minute grid cell which can be filled
    by information from ocean points on the 5 minute grid.

Revised files -------------------------------------

seaice_nland.map :
seaice_sland.map :
  25.4 km byte array of land mask flags
  any point that can be filled with any unmasked (not land or coast)
     point from the higher resolution grid is marked ocean.  This will not
     accurately represent the land, as it over-ascribes ocean.
  some points may display as land now, that used to be ocean.  These are
     due to the unfillable (due to contamination) points now known on the
     higher resolution grid.

seaice_newland :
  30 minute (1/2 degree) byte array of land mask flags
  any point that can be filled with any unmasked (not land or coast)
     point from the higher resolution grid is marked ocean.  This will not
     accurately represent the land, as it over-ascribes ocean.
