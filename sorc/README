Top level notes on the source codes/programs.
Robert Grumbine 22 November 2016

The directories are one for each satellite instrument (ssmi, ssmis, 
amsr2, avhrr) and then a 'general' directory.  'general' contains 
everything which is not unique to a particular satellite.  Each 
satellite directory has two program directories -- one for decoding 
bufr files to a flat binary, and one for doing something useful with 
those data.
