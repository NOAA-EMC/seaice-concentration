Header type information (same across outputs):
*  channel polarizations        (H or V) (0 or 1, respectively)
*  channel frequencies          (real, in GHz)
*  instrument/platform          (int -- see below)

Pointwise:
date/time of observation     (to the minute) -- ncoda: 12 chars -- YYYYMMDDHHMM
lat-lon                      (real)
channel temperatures         (~19 to ~90 GHz, varies slightly by instrument, real, 0.01 precision)
retrieved ice concentration  ([0-1] with 1.57, 2.24, and a couple others as flags)
quality/confidence indicator (1-5, with 1 being best, 5 being bad data, 4 being weather)


#  Additional Information:
quality indicator:
1 best    :
2
3
4 weather : might be valid Tb, but is flagged as not sea ice by filter
5 bad     : fails even cursory tb check

Flags:
1.57 : land
1.95 : coast -- use with care and caution
2.24 : undefined, don't use

6. Satellite ID, integer (n_obs)
