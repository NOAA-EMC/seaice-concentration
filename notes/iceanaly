SSMI data processing

ssmi.c -- original operational file.  Operations in 1997 required that all
source be in single filt.  RG development generally proceeded with individual
files and then concatenated these sources for operational implementation.

ssmimain.c 
  an extracted main program for ssmi data processing.  Later morphs to ssmi.main.c, and
then ssmi.main.C

  originally read sdr format, and did its own date management.  

  For operational implementation, moved to bufr format.

  later, changed to expect data files to be pre-selected to be appropriate
and stopped date management.  This is why jday is now unused argument.


  added hires approach to ssmi.main.c -- regression of sqrt(v^2 - h^2) on
team1 over clear points.  16 mar 2004 in my version.  added counts for
which errors are flagged in qc.  Also start using all ssmi rather than only
F-13.

  team2 added to ssmi.main.C

  Feb 2009: added satno as an argument.  Propted by loss of F-14 and 
bad data from F-15.


  10/31/2011 (mine) new weather filtering approach for F-15, last of the SSMI
and corrupted in 22 GHz.
