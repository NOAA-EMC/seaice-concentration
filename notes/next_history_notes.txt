Notes for next sea ice history and concentration analysis

Land mask should be embedded (or bit-masked) in analysis grids
Placemark #days of ice cover (history/climo)
Additional filtering of bogus points, perhaps by reference grid
Bounding curve analysis of ice areas + extents
History fields uniformly [0-1]
History in grib2 consistently
Each instrument analyzed separately, then combined
